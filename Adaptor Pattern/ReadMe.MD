Four confusing patterns are : 
* Adaptor
* Facade
* Proxy 
* Decorator 

You have to consistently look them up to keep them aparat. 

## Adaptor
* Adaptor Pattern is making two interfaces that are not compatible, compatible. 

## Facade
Taking bunch of complext interation and creating a Facade that you can use. 

## Proxy
We place a proxy instead of calling original object. Reasons could be security/caching. 

## Decorator
Is adding behaviour to some particular object. Without opening up that object and chaning it. 



* If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it  **might be a turkey wrapped with a duck adapter**.
* The intention is not to change the underlying behaviour of anything, add beahviour or anything like that. 
* You adapt something and blindly pass on the request. Adaptors do not consist any inteligent logic simply just pass on the request to another adptee. 


## The Adapter Pattern converts the interface of a class into another interface the clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldnâ€™t otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.
