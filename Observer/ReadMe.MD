## Observer Pattern 

### The Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

* In my opinion it is almost like Pub-Sub model (Push Model).
* In observer pattern we dont talk about publisher but there has to be someone who feeds data OR cahnge the sate of the Subject Class.
