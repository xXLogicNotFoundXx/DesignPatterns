## The Proxy Pattern : The Proxy Pattern provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.
  
There are many variations of the Proxy Pattern, and the variations typically revolve around the way the proxy “controls access.”\
We’re going to talk more about this later, but for now here are a few ways proxies control access:
* As we know, a remote proxy controls access to a remote object.
* A virtual proxy controls access to a resource that is expensive to create.
* A protection proxy controls access to a resource based on access rights.

Use the Proxy Pattern to create a representative object that controls access to another object: 
  * which may be remote 
  * expensive to create 
  * in need of securing
