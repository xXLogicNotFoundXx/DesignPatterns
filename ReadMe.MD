OO Principles
* Abstraction Encapsulate what varies. 
* Encapsulation Favor composition over inheritance. (Strategy) 
* Program to interfaces, not Inheritance implementations.
* Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.
* Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification. (Strategy, Template) 
* Depend on abstractions. Do not depend on concrete classes. (Factory)
* Only talk to your friends. (Facade, Adaptor)

There is no silver bullet. You need to adapt the design pattern to your problem and not try to adapt your problem to the design pattern.
