OO Principles
* Abstraction Encapsulate what varies. 
* Encapsulation Favor composition over inheritance. (Strategy) 
* Program to interfaces, not Inheritance implementations.
* Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.
* Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.
* Dependency Inversion Principle - Depend on abstractions. Do not depend on concrete classes. (Factory)
