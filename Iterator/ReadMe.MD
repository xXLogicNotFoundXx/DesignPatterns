### Well-Managed Collections
* There are lots of ways to stuff objects into a collection.
* Put them in an Array, a Stack, a List, a Map, take your pick. Each has its own advantages and tradeoffs.
* But when your client wants to iterate over your objects, are you going to show him your implementation? 
* We certainly hope not! That just wouldnâ€™t be professional.
