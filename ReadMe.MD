OO Principles
* Abstraction Encapsulate what varies. Encapsulation Favor composition over inheritanceP. olymorphism
* Program to interfaces, not Inheritance implementations.
* Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.
* Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.
* Depend on abstractions. Do not depend on concrete classes.
